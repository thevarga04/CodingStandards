### Indent Size: 2 spaces
We will be using 2 spaces for indent to preserve the space, we already might deal with (very) long object names 
and using 4 spaces might compromise the little space we have for the production code.
Class, method, try withing a condition = 4 x 2 spaces = 8, 4 x 4 = 16 spaces, and that might be too much.
