# Folder By Type : Feature-Oriented Project Structure

## Advocacy for feature-oriented project structure
* Good project design supports smooth parallel working of multiple developers,\
   what means minimal merge conflicts.\
   Of course achieving this would be not possible without adhering to Single Responsibility Principle.
* Assuming that developers are working on various features (in parallel),\
   with FO project structure merging conflicts are minimal.
* Versioning, Scalability or Feature migration - much better than Folder-By-Type\
   (which works well only on 1 feature or only 1 DomainObject per project).
