# Unit Testing Expert Checklist
* Reliable: Valuable (do not mock everything)
* Simple: To Write, Read and Understood, Maintain
* Consistent: Correct results, and resemble each other (mirror what is good)
* Fast: To Execute, To Change


## Additional info
* Good tests provides maximum value with minimum maintenance costs.
* Good tests act as a safety net â€” a tool that provides insurance against the vast majority of regressions.
* Tendency to write a complex test might be an indicator of over-engineered code.
* Isolation issue - avoid adding more dependencies in test classes than in production code. 
* Integration test does not meet criteria for a unit test. Create them somewhere else.
* Good unit tests are thorough, but there are other values as well, like maintainability, ...
* Good testing strategy is layered: Unit tests, Integration tests, End-to-End tests, ...
* The Test Pyramid advocates for a certain ratio of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* End-to-end tests should be in the minority, unit tests in the majority, and integration tests somewhere in the middle.
* End-to-end tests favor protection against regressions, while unit tests favor fast feedback.
* Use the black-box testing method when writing tests. Use the white-box method when analyzing the tests.
