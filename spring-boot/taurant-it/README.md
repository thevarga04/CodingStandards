# Integration and End-to-end Tests
We have two other options in a Test Pyramid
* Integration Tests (@WebMvcTest)
* End-to-end Tests (@SpringBootTest)

#### Integration tests are simple to set up, but its functionality are limited.

#### End-to-end Tests can test real application functionality, but can be challenging to set up.
